# Hey there! 👋

I'm a DevOps enthusiast who loves tinkering with cloud infrastructure and automation. Currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer, I spend my days crafting CI/CD pipelines, managing Kubernetes clusters, and making sure systems run smoothly.

## What I Do

When I'm not debugging production issues or optimizing deployments, you'll find me:

- Experimenting with new tools in my home lab
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Writing about my tech adventures and learnings
- Breaking (and fixing!) things in my test environment

## Tech Stack

I work with a variety of tools and technologies:

- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Scripting**: Python, Bash

## Current Focus

These days, I'm particularly interested in:

- GitOps practices and tools
- Cloud-native security
- Infrastructure automation
- Performance optimization

## Beyond Tech

When I'm not immersed in DevOps, I enjoy:

- 🏃‍♂️ Trail running
- 📚 Reading tech blogs and sci-fi
- 🎸 Playing guitar
- 🌱 Contributing to tech communities
